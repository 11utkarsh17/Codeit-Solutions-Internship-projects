Overview of the Project
Project: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on COVID-19 Dataset

Objective
The objective of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a COVID-19 dataset. The analysis aims to uncover insights into COVID-19 trends, distributions, correlations, and outliers through visualizations.

Key Activities

Data Cleaning: Ensure the dataset is cleaned and free from inconsistencies, missing values, or duplicates related to COVID-19 data.

Data Visualization: Create visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to understand COVID-19 data distributions, trends over time, and geographical patterns.

Correlation Analysis: Identify correlations between different COVID-19 metrics, such as cases, deaths, and recovery rates across various regions and time periods.

Technologies Used

Python: The primary programming language for data analysis.
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.

This project aims to provide meaningful insights into the COVID-19 pandemic using comprehensive data analysis techniques, contributing to informed decision-making and public health strategies at CodTech IT Solutions.
